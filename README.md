# Project
Web application that allows project managers to manage a house renovation project.

This website works with Apache and MySQL to connect to a database, this is done by using XAMPP.

The main files being worked on are:
- app.js
- files in the public folder
- files in the views folder

The packages installed are:
├── bcryptjs@2.4.3
├── cookie-parser@1.4.6
├── dotenv@16.0.3
├── express-session@1.17.3
├── express@4.18.2
├── hbs@4.2.0
├── mysql@2.18.1
└── nodemon@2.0.20

The node modules file is missing as it is too big in size.
