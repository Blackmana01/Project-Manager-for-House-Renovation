# Project
Web application that allows project managers to manage a house renovation project.

This website works with Apache and MySQL to connect to a database, this is done by using XAMPP.

The main files being worked on are:
- app.js
- files in the public folder
- files in the views folder

The packages installed are:
- express-generator@4.16.1
- npm@9.1.2

The node modules file is missing as it includes too many files.
